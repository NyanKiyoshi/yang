## Really? Another one?

Was this necessary? Probably not. There are dozens of extensions that already
provide a similar functionality to Yang! (see [Related
Extensions](#related-extensions)).

**BUT**, I wasn't able to find one that simultaneously:

1. Supported bangs directly from the URL bar.
2. Redirected directly, without querying to DuckDuckGo to resolve the
   bang<sup>1</sup>.
3. Worked on every major search engine out there.

Yang! is an add-on that doesn't feel old.

<sub><sup>1</sup> This greatly reduces the redirection times, as shown by
[DuckDuckGo !Bangs but Faster](https://bangs-but-faster.inclushe.com/).</small></sub>

<br>

## How does it work?

Simply install the extension and then use any of the supported [DuckDuckGo
bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs).

<br>

Bangs can be used at the **beginning or at the end** of the query, e.g.:

```console
!deepl I love bangs and I'm not talking about hair.
```

is equivalent to

```console
I love bangs and I'm not talking about hair. !deepl
```

<br>

Bangs are resolved locally, without sending any request to DuckDuckGo, which
makes the process much faster.

## FAQs

<details>
  <summary><b>Does it work on Google Chrome?</b></summary>
  <p><br>No clue, I don't have that package installed on my system. I will not
  give support to it myself, but PRs are welcome.</p>
